# Sample Superstore Data Project

One thing I really enjoy doing is visualizing data. In this project, I created a public dashboard for analyzing Sales Performance of the Superstore dataset from Tableau, but with a slight twist. I decided to do it in Power BI. Power BI and Tableau are very different yet both great environments for visualizing data, and I enjoy being able to utilize both regularly. 


##### Step 1: Acquiring the data

The data for Tableau's Sample Superstore is hosted on [this website](https://datawonders.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TABLEAU/blog/2022/10/26/1953431553/Where+Can+I+Find+Superstore+Sales#Workbooks-and-Data-Sources). This website was provided by Tableau's community team, and is perfectly safe.


##### Step 2: Creating the Dashboard

With the data loaded into Power BI, I set out creating the entire dashboard. 

The result is a very clean and clear looking chart:
