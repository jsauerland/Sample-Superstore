# Sample Superstore Data Project

One thing I really enjoy doing is visualizing data. In this project, I created a public dashboard for analyzing Sales Performance of the Superstore dataset from Tableau, but with a slight twist. I decided to do it in Power BI. Power BI and Tableau are very different yet both great environments for visualizing data, and I enjoy being able to utilize both regularly. 


##### Step 1: Acquiring and loading the data

The data for Tableau's Sample Superstore is hosted on [this website](https://datawonders.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TABLEAU/blog/2022/10/26/1953431553/Where+Can+I+Find+Superstore+Sales#Workbooks-and-Data-Sources). This website was provided by Tableau's community team, and is perfectly safe.

There's nothing crazy about this dataset, so it's easy to just open up Power BI, and load it in by importing it as Excel file

##### Step 2 (optional): Creating a mockup

Many data storytellers including myself like to plan out what their dashboard looks like before embarking on the arduous journey of creating it. This helps to clearly understand exactly how the dashboard should look, and what to include.

Figma, or PowerPoint is a great way to achieve this. Both allow you to create text, boxes, shapes, images, and then, drop them in place to create a 'mockup' of the design. 


##### Step 3: Creating the Dashboard

With the data loaded into Power BI, I set out creating the entire dashboard. 

I started out with a simple 'Monthly Orders' visual that would show orders per month, and would feature a neat average line. 

- Bullet 1
-- Create a Clustered Column Chart
-- Drag Month of Order Date to X-Axis

The result is a very clean and clear looking chart:
